# Hotel-Booking-model
Machine learning model used to predict the price of room in various months of year

# Steps Used

###### Cleaning the data and preparing the dataset for modelling
  -	Checking for Null Values
  -	Filling the null values with 0
  -	Filtering the data

###### Analysing the proprotion of guests in various countries
  -	Using chloropleth form plotly to represent the conclusion on map with color differentiation

###### Finding the amount payed for per night
  -	Finding amount variation according to hotel type: Resort, City

###### Finding Price Fluctation for per night per year
  -	Sorting data and Using a line plot to represent the conclusions

###### Finding the duration of stay
  -	Finding the count of people who booked the hotel but never arrived
  -	Using a bar plot to represent the same

###### Selecting important features
  -	Using Correlation
  -	Seperating numerical and categorical columns
  -	Extract derived features from fata
  -	Using Mean Encoding to convert string to int type data

###### Handling Outliers

###### Applying feature importance on data to select most impt features

###### Using Logistic Regression (Classification)
  - Applying ML Algorithm and crossvalidate it
  
###### Using various Algorithms to find accuracy on the model
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Naive Bayes
  - Decision Tree - Classifier
  - KNN
  - Finding the model which perfromed the best and model having the highest ccuracy.
